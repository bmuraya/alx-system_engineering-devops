# 0x16. API advanced

Welcome to the **0x16. API advanced** repository! This repository contains all the projects and tasks completed as a part of my journey as an expert software engineer, where I learned how to work with advanced operations and techniques of API. In this repository, you will find a series of tasks that will help you explore the world of APIs, such as data retrieval, parsing, and authentication.

## Tasks

### [0. 0-subs.py](./0-subs.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and returns the number of subscribers of a given subreddit. 

### [1. Top Ten](./1-top_ten.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

### [2. Recurse it!](./2-recurse.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list of all hot articles recursively.

### [3. Count it!](./100-count.py)
This task requires writing a function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles and prints a sorted count of given keywords.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and run the desired script in your terminal followed by the necessary arguments. For example, to execute the *0-subs.py* script, run the following command:
```
$ ./0-subs.py programming
```
This will return the number of subscribers for the *programming* subreddit.
